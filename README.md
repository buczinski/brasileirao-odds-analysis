# Brasileirão Odds Analysis (Work in Progress)

This project analyzes **betting odds and match results** from the Brasileirão (Brazilian football league) to explore trends, evaluate prediction models, and compare pre-match odds against actual outcomes.

---

##  Current Status

- **Data**: A few rounds of Brasileirão results and odds have been collected and stored as CSV files.  
- **Code**: Scripts are available to fetch data from free APIs and update CSV files.  
- **Automation**: A local **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** updates the CSV after each round.  

⚠️ **Note**: This project is a work in progress and not yet fully automated or complete.

## Features / Goals

- Fetch odds and results data using free APIs.  
- Automate updates after every round using a DAG (eventually running on a cloud VM).  
- Store historical data on the cloud for easy access and analysis.  
- Analyze odds accuracy, trends, and patterns in match outcomes.

## Future Plans

- **More Data**:  
  - Collect squad information, player stats, transfers, injuries, and match lineups via web scraping.  

- **Cloud Integration**:  
  - Run the DAG on a virtual machine and save data to cloud storage for scalability.  

- **Enhanced Analysis**:  
  - Create visualizations, predictive models, and metrics to assess betting odds.  

- **Documentation**:  
  - Provide clear usage instructions and examples.
